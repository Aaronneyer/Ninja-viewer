# Ninja

This is a tool used for viewing information generated by the
[Ninja](https://github.com/Aaronneyer/Ninja) tool. Ninja pulls information down
from BigQuery(With githubarchive) and the Github API on the top 500
repositories(By number of forks) as of April 2012. It then generates a graph
representing the connections between users. For a full write up of gathering
all the data, you can check out the [Ninja](https://github.com/Aaronneyer/Ninja)
repository.

Ninja generates the Graphml files, which are then converted into JSON using
Gremlin and Groovy, and further converted into the JSON format expected by
D3JS. There are slightly less than 200 repositories with information available,
as a large number of the top 500 repositories in April 2012, have stopped being
active.

From the website, hosted at [ninja.aaronneyer.com](http://ninja.aaronneyer.com),
you can select one of the repositories that has information, and view the social
network for the repository as it changes over time.

### Credits and Tools used

[BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/) with [Githubarchive](http://www.githubarchive.org/)
was used for gathering most of the information, using the
[Ruby Google API Client](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-ruby-client/)

[Github API](http://developer.github.com/) was used for a few pieces of information
not available on Githubarchive.

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) was used for generating the graphs, with assistance
from [this tutorial](http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/02/how-to-make-an-interactive-network-visualization/)

The Ninja tool was developed as part of my work with [Aron Lindberg](https://github.com/aronlindberg),
who is doing research at Case Western Reservve University involving Social Network Analysis on Github.
